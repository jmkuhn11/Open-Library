# Open-Library

## Description

As new students in Boot Camp, we have less time on our hands to search and enjoy new books. We were looking for an easy way to gain recommendations based off of past authors and subjects we liked. Thus, we created a service that will look through a database for us and give us good book options based off of our interests. Creating this service reuired an in depth understanding of the workings of server side API's and javascript as a whole. Completing this project helped us work on those qualities. We also cemented using multiple html, css, and js files for one project, and implementing code between all of the files. All of the group members now have a better idea on how to format, style, and run a more complex website that is meant to be appealing for other clients to use.

## Installation

Bulma for CSS

jQuery for js

Fetch Open-Library API

## Usage

Users will open to our main page, and will be oresented with a welcome gretting and a short description on how to use our service. They will then enter an author and/or a subject that they really like and search for books that fit that criteria. They will then be given multiple pages of the results listing various information about books that they might like, with 'next' and 'previous' buttons to look through the results. Each book will also have 2 buttons to search or save data. 'More Information" will bring you to another website on another tab with further information specifically for the book you are looking at. "Add to Favorites" will allow you to save the book to your favorites page for use at a later date. At any time, you can access the home or favorites page using the navbar at the top of the screen. And once scrolling through your favorites on the favorites page, you have the ability to remove books from there once finished reading.
